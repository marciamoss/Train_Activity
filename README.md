# Train_Activity

* A train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and         manipulates the information with Moment.js. 
* This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes        remain until they arrive at their station.
* When adding trains, administrators can submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
* This app calculates when the next train will arrive. This is relative to the current time.
  
* Users from many different machines can view same train times.

* The "minutes to arrival" and "next train time" text updates once every minute.
